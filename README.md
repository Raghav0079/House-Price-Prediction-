# House Price Prediction Project

This repository contains a project for analyzing and predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling.

## Project Structure

The repository has the following structure:


### File Description

- **`HousePricePrediction.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the entire workflow for the project, including data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict house prices based on features such as area, number of bedrooms, and house age. It includes the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and analyze the relationships between features and house prices.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Apply techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality.
4. **Model Training**: Use gradient descent and other algorithms to train predictive models.
5. **Prediction**: Predict house prices for new data points and visualize the results.

## Requirements

To run the project, you need the following Python libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`

Install the dependencies using pip:

```sh
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas scikit-learn
